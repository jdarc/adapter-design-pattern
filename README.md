# Adapter Design Pattern 

This design pattern is described by: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter

This project aims to demonstrate how the adapter design pattern can be used to 
provide an abstraction layer that decouples a system from concrete implementations.

It also aims to demonstrate one possible set up a Kotlin multi-module gradle project.

## Purpose
In this somewhat contrived demonstration, there are 3 modules...

- common
  - contains base classes and interfaces used across all modules
- game
  - the application specific classes and interfaces, the final deployable unit
  - uses a simplistic IOC container for demo purposes 
- physics
  - the module that encapsulates the "Loco" physics engine and provides the adapters
  - hides the concrete physics engine, no leaking of concrete implementation details
  - wires up dependencies
    
There is also some aspect of other patterns present in this demonstration, but its 
primary goal is to promote the idea of maximum cohesion, minimum coupling.

The simulation is trivial and simply accelerates a body due to gravity.
